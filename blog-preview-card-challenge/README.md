## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables for color, spacing, typography)
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Custom font integration (Figtree)
- Accessibility best practices (color contrast, keyboard focus)


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving:
- Advanced responsive techniques (e.g., CSS Grid, container queries)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance, screen reader support)
- More interactive UI states (animations, transitions)
- Using modern CSS features for even cleaner code
